This project serves the purpose of learning, helps to understand how to configure and use compute shader.
To use it properly, simply read the code and descriptions.

Code files:

cpuSideCode.cs		- contains MonoBehavior class, that:
				initializes data and compute shaders
				performs gpu calculations
				handles user input
csFractal.compute	- compute shader, that performs gpu calculations

Both files are comprehensively commented, but if there is something you don't understand, email me, and I will add more comments.
